      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!-- <img class="announce" src="images/Announcement2.png" width="50" height="50" alt="illustration of a microphone"> -->
      <p class="intro">I've have been hiring talent for over 10 years in large blue-chip multinationals, and
        latterly in a crypto Fintech. I love the challenge of sourcing niche and diverse skills for technical
        and
        corporate roles. I live in Scotland and when I'm not busy hunting that special unicorn, you can find me
        roaming
        the Highlands doing photography. I love tech and learning. I'm currently upskilling and learning to code
        in hmtl, css, javascraipt and getting creating with 3D modelling in Blender. </p>
